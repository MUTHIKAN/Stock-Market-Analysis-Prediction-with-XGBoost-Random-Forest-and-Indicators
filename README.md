- **Prediction Models**: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression.
- **Technical Indicators**: Includes moving averages, RSI, etc.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes actual vs predicted stock prices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Streamlit, XGBoost, RandomForest, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
